# Introduction

## Goals

The CodeLab Toolkit is a collection of guides for common tools/patterns that can be found in Spark Projects intended to foster a positive and educational development experience. The goal of this toolkit is to provide a quick reference for developers when implementing new features or to learn about a new tool/pattern.

:::note

This website is not solely or even intended for the purpose of educating incoming associates regarding relavant languages, frameworks, or libraries needed for project development within their assigned teams. That responsibility is left to the developer bootcamps distributed at the beginning of a term. Instead, it aims to provide developers with information and skills that they can carry on beyond the scope of CodeLab.
