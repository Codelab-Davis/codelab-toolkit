# async/await: Simplifying Promise Consumption

# Introduction

`async/await` is a feature of JavaScript that allows developers to work with promises in simple and synchronous-like fashion. It was introduced back in 2017 and replaced older methods of consuming promises such as chaining `then()` and `catch()` as well as using callbacks, which we will cover as well.

# `async` Functions

- Declaring a function as `async` forces the function to return a promise
- Values that are not promises are returned as resolved promises

```jsx
const foo = async () => 1;

foo().then((value) => console.log(value)); // 1
```

# `await`

- The `await` keyword makes JavaScript wait for a promise to be settled
- This allows for the code to appear more “synchronous”
- Note that the `await` keyword can only appear inside the body of an `async` function, however, it can also be used at the top-level of a module

```jsx
const res = axios.get("https://www.example.com");

export default await res;
```

# Common Uses

## Fetching Data from an API

One of the most common ways `async/await` is utilized is when fetching data from some form of API.

```jsx
// Function that makes a GET request to an example API
const fetchData = async () => {
	try {
		// Response is "awaited" and logged to the console once fulfilled
		const response = await axios.get("https://www.example.com");
		console.log(response.data)
	} catch (err) {
		// Should the request be rejected the associated error object will be logged
		console.log(err)
	}
}
```

## Retrieving Data from a Database

Another way `async/await` can come up is when a developer is trying to query data from a database in the backend

```jsx
// Example user router
router.route("/:id").get(async (req, res) => {
	try {
		// Query to the DB is made and result is sent to client once fulfilled
		const users = await User.findById(req.params.id);
		res.send(users);
	} catch (err) {
		// Error object is logged and send client-side if request is rejected
		console.log(err);
		res.status(400).send(err);
	}
});

// NOTE: Mongoose queries are NOT promises, however they are thenable 
// objects that permit the use of async/await
```

# Promises

Promises provide a method for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. A typical example of this would be fetching data from an API or querying a database.

Promises can be in one of three states:

- Pending: The promise is in its initial state and is working on resolving a particular value
- Fulfilled: The promise has settled and the resulting value can be successfully consumed
- Rejected: The promise has failed with an err

Using the `then()` , the user can access the resolved data using a callback function. On the other hand, if the promise was rejected, the user can access the associated error object using the `catch()` method.

A simple example of promise consumption is as follows:

```jsx
// Creates random integer between 1-10
const randomInt = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	if (randomInt >= 5) {
		resolve("Number is greater or equal to 5");
	} else {
		reject(new Error("Number is less than 5"));
	}
});

promise
	.then((res) => {
		console.log(res) // "Number is greater or equal to 5"
	})
	.catch((err) => {
		console.log(err.toString()) // "Error: Number is less than 5"
	});
```

# Callbacks

Callbacks provide a way for users to invoke a separate function that is passed in as an argument to the currently called function.

A simple example of how callbacks function is shown as follows:

```jsx
const callback = () => {
	console.log("Callback invoked!");
}

const log = (message, callback) => {
	console.log(message);
	callback();
}

log("Hello World!", callback);
/*
 * > Hello World!
 * > Callback invoked!
 */
```

Callbacks is an incredibly powerful feature of JavaScript that is used in a variety of applications both front and back-end. They allow for a modular and well-structured manner to invoke functions.
