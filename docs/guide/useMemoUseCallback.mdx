# useMemo and useCallback Hooks: Optimization

## Introduction

:::warning

Don’t Optimize Prematurely!
Overusing these hooks could actually lead to worse performance.

:::

As apps get larger, it becomes increasingly important to optimize performance. Two of the most important React Hooks for performance optimization are `useMemo` and `useCallback`.

`useMemo` returns a memoized value, which is a cached value that is only recalculated when its dependencies change. This can be useful for avoiding unnecessary re-renders, especially when performing expensive calculations or fetching data.

`useCallback` returns a memoized callback function, which is a function that is only recreated when its dependencies change. This can be useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components when passing callback functions as props.

By using `useMemo` and `useCallback` wisely, you can improve the performance of your React applications and provide a better user experience.

## `useMemo`: Cached Values

The `useMemo` hook in React is used to cache variables between re-renders. Usually, variables will be recalcuated if they are within the scope of the re-render, but for some variables this can be inefficient since they are expensive to calculate.

### How to use `useMemo`

`useMemo` is a hook that takes two arguments:

-   Calculation function: a function that returns what value you want to calculate
-   Dependencies: A list of items that, when changed, will cause a recalculation of the value

Here is an example where we are sorting some notes:

```jsx
const sortedNotes = useMemo(() => notes.sort(), [notes]);
```

When the `notes` variables changes, the `sortedNotes` variable will recalculate itself.

### When to use `useMemo`

`useMemo` should be used when you have a expensive calculation. A good example of an expensive calculation is the `filter` function:

```jsx
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0);
```

For large datasets, recalculating a value like this on every re-render is expensive, so we should wrap it in a `useMemo`:

```jsx
const evenNumbers = useMemo(
    () => numbers.filter((number) => number % 2 === 0),
    [numbers]
);
```

:::tip

Note that even if it is an expensive calculation, other factors such as dataset size affect the actual performance of the app. Just because a calculation is expensive does NOT necessarily mean it should automatically be wrapped in a `useMemo`.

:::

It is also useful for `useMemo` to be used for a value that is a dependency of another hook. The memoized value can help avoid both its own recalculation and the recalculation of the dependent hook.

```jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
    // This is an expensive calculation.
    return Math.pow(10, count);
}, [count]);

// This hook depends on the memoized value.
useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Memoized value:", memoizedValue);
}, [memoizedValue]);
```

### When NOT to use `useMemo`

In general, `useMemo` shouldn’t be used until the developer is sure that its addition will optimize the app. Usually some amount of manual testing is needed to determine if `useMemo` is or isn’t needed in an app.

But to be more specific, it is not usually necessary to use `useMemo` on inexpensive calculations, such as basic arithmetic:

```jsx
const half = const half = numbers / 2;
```

## `useCallback`: Cached Functions

`useCallback` is a React Hook that returns a memoized callback function. A memoized callback function is a function that is only recreated when its dependencies change. This can be useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components when passing callback functions as props.

### How to use `useCallback`

The `useCallback` hook takes two arguments:

-   **Callback function:** A function that you want to memoize.
-   **Dependencies:** An array of dependencies. The `useCallback` hook will only recreate the callback function if any of the dependencies change.

Here is an example of how to use the `useCallback` hook:

```jsx
const doSomethingWithNumber = useCallback(
    () => doSomething(magicNumber),
    [magicNumber]
);
```

Now, `doSomethingWithNumber` is a callback function that calls another function onto the variable `magicNumber`. It recreates itself whenever `magicNumber` changes, since the function would do something different then.

### When to use `useCallback`

It’s generally recommended to wrap a function in a `useCallback` if:

-   It is a dependency of another `useMemo` or `memo` and you don’t want the function to cause unnecessary re-renders
-   It is a dependency of another hook, like `useEffect` so that it does not recalculate unnecessarily
