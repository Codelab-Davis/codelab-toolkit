# useReducer Hook: A Safe Way to Interact with Data

## Introduction

`useReducer` is a React hook that allows you to manage complex state in your components. It is similar to `useState`, but it offers a few advantages, such as the ability to manage complex state and improve performance.

`useReducer` allows you to control how your data or state can be interacted with. For example, if you have a reducer function that only allows the user to increment or decrement a counter, then you can make it so that the developer cannot accidentally set the counter to a negative number.

## How to use `useReducer`

### Defining a Reducer

First, we need to define a reducer, which is a function that takes two arguments, `state` and `action`


``` jsx
function reducer(state, action) {
  // ...
}
```

Let’s define the functionality of this reducer now. Let’s say we wanted to build a reducer for a counter, where the user is allowed to increment, decrement, or reset the counter. In this case, the state is just an integer.

```jsx
function countReducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case "increment":
            return state + 1;
        case "decrement":
            return state > 0 ? state - 1 : state;
        case "reset":
            return 0;
        default:
            throw new Error("Invalid action type");
    }
}
```

As you can see there is a switch statement for the action’s `type`, and depending on its value, the reducer does different actions. Notice that the reducer always ****************************************************************************************************returns what the state should be after the action.****************************************************************************************************

Now, let’s take a look at how to use this reducer.

## Using a Reducer

To use a reducer in a component, we can use the `useReducer` hook:

``` jsx
const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(countReducer, 0);
```
`The 0 here is the initial value of the reducer’s state`.

Then, we can use the dispatch to change the state as such:

```jsx
const onIncrementPress = () => {
        dispatch({ type: "increment" });
    };

...

<Button onClick={onIncrementPress}>+</Button>
```

## Using a Context with `useReducer`

Much like `useState`, `useReducer`'s state and dispatch functions are confined to the component that they are defined in. Because of this, if you created two components that use the same reducer…

```jsx
function Component1() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, 0)
  ...
}

function Component2() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, 0)
  ...
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Component1 />
    <Component2 />
  )
}
```

…these components will not share the same state, since there are two separate instances of the same reducer.

So, what do we do if we have a state that needs to be accessed by many components within a certain scope? We can use a React Context! To learn more about `useContext` please take a look at [useContext Hook: Another Way to Share Data](https://www.notion.so/useContext-Hook-Another-Way-to-Share-Data-d67de2df40fb4669ab547e1a52f6f7a3?pvs=21).

Let’s do this for the counter example from the previous section, starting with creating the context:

```jsx
const CounterContext = createContext({
    count: 0,
    dispatch: () => {},
});
```

Next, let’s create a provider to provide a certain scope with this context. Here, we can define our reducer:

```jsx
function CounterProvider({ children }) {
    const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(countReducer, 0);

    return (
        <CounterContext.Provider
            value={{
                count,
                dispatch,
            }}
        >
            {children}
        </CounterContext.Provider>
    );
}
```
After wrapping the relevant code with the context, we can use this in components within the scope, ex:

```jsx
function CounterDisplay() {
    const { count } = useContext(CounterContext);

    return (
        <span className="flex w-full justify-center text-xl font-bold">
            {count}
        </span>
    );
}

function IncrementButton() {
    const { dispatch } = useContext(CounterContext);

    const onIncrementPress = () => {
        dispatch({ type: "increment" });
    };

    return <Button onClick={onIncrementPress}>+</Button>;
}
```

## Example: Counter using a Reducer Context

<Embed src="https://keith-loww.github.io/sandpack-test/#/usereducer/context" />


- `src/lib/store/Counter.tsx`
    - Defines the reducer
    - Defines the context
    - Defines the provider
- `src/App.tsx`
    - Defines the components that use the reducer/context
- `src/main.tsx`
    - Wraps the app with the provider

## Example: Using Reducer in the Page of Posts

<Embed src="https://keith-loww.github.io/sandpack-test/#/usereducer/posts" />

- `src/lib/store/Posts.tsx`
    - Defines the reducer
    - Defines the context
    - Defines a provider for the context
- `src/lib/hooks/usePosts.tsx`
    - Defines a custom hook for the `PostsContext` for error handling
- `src/main.tsx`
    - Wraps the `App` in the `PostsProvider`
- `src/App.tsx`
    - Makes functions that use the `dispatch` function from the reducer to:
        - Like a post
        - Add a post
