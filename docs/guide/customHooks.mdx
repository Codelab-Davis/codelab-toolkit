# Custom Hooks

# Introduction

While React comes with many hooks out of the box, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, sometimes it could be useful to have a hook that is more specifically suited for what you are building. That‚Äôs where defining your own hooks can come in handy.

Custom hooks in React are a great way to share \***\*\*\*\*\***logic\***\*\*\*\*\*** between components, and by doing so, it reduces code duplication and improves the separation of concerns.

# How to use a Custom Hook?

A custom hook is can be defined by creating a JavaScript function beginning with `use`. So, for example, if we wanted to define a hook for a counter, we could name it `useCounter`.

```jsx
function useCounter() {
	...
}
```

Let‚Äôs expand on this example. Let‚Äôs say we want a counter app, with a count value and a way to increment and decrement values. This is how we would do that without a custom hook:

```jsx
function App() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const handleIncrement = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
    };

    const handleDecrement = () => {
        setCount(count - 1);
    };

    return (
        <>
            <div>
                <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
                <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
                <button onClick={handleDecrement}>Decrement</button>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```

But what happens when we want two counters?

```jsx
function App() {
    const [count1, setCount1] = useState(0);
    const [count2, setCount2] = useState(0);

    const handleIncrement1 = () => {
        setCount1(count1 + 1);
    };

    const handleDecrement1 = () => {
        setCount1(count1 - 1);
    };

    const handleIncrement2 = () => {
        setCount2(count2 + 1);
    };

    const handleDecrement2 = () => {
        setCount2(count2 - 1);
    };

    return (
        <>
            <div>
                <h1>Count 1: {count1}</h1>
                <button onClick={handleIncrement1}>Increment</button>
                <button onClick={handleDecrement1}>Decrement</button>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Count 2: {count2}</h1>
                <button onClick={handleIncrement2}>Increment</button>
                <button onClick={handleDecrement2}>Decrement</button>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```

Suddenly, the app is much bigger, and more bloated. There‚Äôs a lot of duplicated code here, but since we need to handle two different `useState` values here, there‚Äôs not much we could do.

The solution? Define a custom hook for a counter:

```jsx
function useCounter(initialValue: number = 0) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);

  function handleIncrement() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  function handleDecrement() {
    setCount(count - 1);
  }

  return {
    count,
    handleIncrement,
    handleDecrement,
  };
}
```

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è **Hooks Automatically Share Logic, Not Values**

Notice that we needed to return the `count`, `handleIncrement`, and `handleDecrement` values within the hook itself. You must manually return any values that your hook should return.

</aside>

Now, our single counter example looks like this:

```jsx
function App() {
    const { count, handleIncrement, handleDecrement } = useCounter(0);

    return (
        <>
            <div>
                <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
                <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
                <button onClick={handleDecrement}>Decrement</button>
            </div>
        </>
    );
}
```

‚Ä¶and our double counter example:

```
function App() {
  const { count: count1, handleIncrement: handleIncrement1, handleDecrement: handleDecrement1 } = useCounter(0);
  const { count: count2, handleIncrement: handleIncrement2, handleDecrement: handleDecrement2 } = useCounter(0);

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <h1>Counter 1: {count1}</h1>
        <button onClick={handleIncrement1}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={handleDecrement1}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Counter 2: {count2}</h1>
        <button onClick={handleIncrement2}>Increment</button>
        <button onClick={handleDecrement2}>Decrement</button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

A lot of the duplicated code has been removed and the custom hook provides abstraction for the functionality of the counter! üòÄ

## Example: `useCounter` Hook

# When to use a Custom Hook?

It‚Äôs important to note that hooks aren‚Äôt necessarily the solution to all duplicated pieces of code. If we wanted to define a way to get a sorted array‚Ä¶

```jsx
// ‚ùå This doesn't need to be a hook
function useSorted(array) {
	...
}

// ‚úÖ Use a regular function instead!
function getSorted(array) {
	...
}
```

‚Ä¶ since this doesn‚Äôt have to use any stateful logic in the app, there is no reason to make it a hook. This makes it so that you can use this function anywhere, not just on the top-level of your component.

It‚Äôs also good to keep custom hooks for easily definable, high-level use-cases. If you cannot easily name your custom hook, its logic might be too entangled with the rest of your app to consider a custom hook as an option.

# Example: `useTheme`

## Important Parts

`src/hooks/useTheme.tsx` defines a hook that returns the theme‚Äôs current state, as well as a function to toggle the Tailwind Theme

-   It toggles the theme via an HTML class, refer to the [official Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) for more information

`src/App.tsx` uses the `useTheme` hook, it changes the text based on the state, as well as a button that toggles the theme using the function.

To understand how the text is being conditionally rendered, consider reading [Conditional Rendering](https://www.notion.so/Conditional-Rendering-081ef7c362904b4c805c8d3fcb8d6022?pvs=21)
