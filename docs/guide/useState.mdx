# useState Hook: A Simple Way to Handle Data

# Introduction

`useState`Â is a fundamental hook in React that allows developers to manage and manipulate **state** in *functional* components. In React, **state** refers to any data that can change over time and impacts how a component behaves. Using **state** to store your data allows it to persist between renders and trigger new renders when the data is updated.

To understand how this works, let's delve into an example. Imagine youâ€™re building a simple counter component that increments a number when a user interacts with it. This component needs to keep track of its current value. One approach could be to use a regular JavaScript variable, but this won't trigger re-renders when the value changes, and React components rely on re-renders to update the user interface.

This is where `useState` comes into play. It offers a React-friendly way to handle this type of dynamic data. By using `useState`, you can declare a ************state************ variable that keeps track of your counter and triggers a re-render when the counter is incremented.

# How to use `useState`

1. Import React at the top of your JSX or TSX file.
2. Call `useState` at the top level of your component to declare a state variable.
    1. Note: Since `useState` is a hook, you **cannot** call it inside loops or conditions. If necessary, you can extract a new component and move the state into it.
    
    ```jsx
    function MyComponent() {
      const [age, setAge] = React.useState(42);
      const [name, setName] = React.useState('Taylor');
      // ...
    ```
    
3. `useState` will return an array with two items:
    1. The current state of your state variable, initially set to the state you provided.
    2. The set function that lets you change the value of your state.
    3. Note: The convention is to name state variables like `[something, setSomething]`
4. To update whatâ€™s on the screen, call the *set* function with some next state:
    
    ```jsx
    function handleClick() {
      setName('Robin');
    }
    ```
    

# Examples:

## Basic Example

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

// Create a component that uses the context
function MyComponent() {
	const [clickCount, setClickCount] = useState(0);

  return (
		<Button 
			onClick={() => setClickCount(clickCount+1)}
		>
			{clickCount}
		</Button>
	);
}
```

## Why a regular variable isnâ€™t enough

Notice in the below example that clicking the `Next` button doesnâ€™t update our view. Behind the scenes, the `index` variable is actually being incremented every time the `Next` button is pressed. However, since there is no call for a re-render on our view, our component is not being updated to reflect the new value of `index`.

Before moving on to the next example, try to update the code below to include a `useState` hook to call a re-render on our view!

## Using a state variable

The below example builds off of the previous component, but instead uses a `useState` hook to re-render our component when the `Next` button is clicked. Now when we click the `Next` button, our component is re-rendered to reflect the updated value of `index` and the `sculpture` object.

## Updating arrays in state

When using an array or an object in state variables, we cannot mutate the existing state directly. Since `state` in React is considered read-only, we must replace our object or array with an entirely new object or array.

```jsx
// ðŸš© Don't mutate an object in state like this:
form.firstName = 'Taylor';
```

```jsx
// âœ… Replace state with a new object
setForm({
  ...form,
  firstName: 'Taylor'
});
```
