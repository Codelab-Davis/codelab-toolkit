# Conditional Rendering

## Introduction

When developing React components, note that one may need to display different variants of the component or sometimes another component altogether depending on the active user, type of data passed in, etc. In these scenarios, we must employ conditional rendering.

## Mechanism

Conditional rendering in React behaves in a similar manner to normal conditional statements you’ve all learned in your intro to programming classes. Given a certain conditional statement, we return some JSX. For example, in the following snippet, we display the appropriate button depending on whether the application is in a logged in state as defined by `props`.

```tsx
export default function Example({ isLoggedIn }) {
	if (isLoggedIn) {
		return <button>Log Out</button>;
	}
	return <button>Log In</button>;
}
```

:::tip

As conditional rendering based on `props` is an incredibly common pattern seen across React development, you should most definitely take the time to understand what is going on here.

Rendering the UI based on state is also incredibly common. Say for example, we’re rendering a list of tasks and if the number of tasks we need to display exceeds 10, we show the extra tasks in a component called `<MoreTasks />`.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function TaskList({ isLoggedIn }) {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState();

  return (
    <ul>
      {tasks.slice(0, 10).map((task) => (
        <li>{task.name}</li>
      ))}
      {tasks.length > 10 && <MoreTasks tasks={tasks.slice(10)} />}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Note the use of `&&` in the snippet above and explore how it used in the section below.

## Code Alternatives

While writing classic `if`/`else` statements works just fine, you will more than likely encounter one of the two following alternatives used in application instead.

### Using the Ternary Operator

More common than not, the ternary operator, `?`, is used in place of `if` and `else` statements for better code readability. Using the above example, the equivalent would be:

```tsx
export default function Example({ isLoggedIn }) {
	return isLoggedIn ? <button>Log Out</button> : <button>Log In</button>;
}
```

### Using logical `&&`

Building upon the use of the ternary operator, should we not need anything to be rendered in the `else` case, we can simply use short circuit evaluation in conjunction with the fact that React will not render anything if `false` is returned from a component. For example, consider the following example:

```tsx
export default function Example({ isLoggedIn }) {
	return isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />;
}
```

In this scenario, if `isLoggedIn` is `true` , React will return the latter value from the statement, in this case it’s `<AdminPanel />` . On the other hand, should `isLoggedIn` be `false`, React will return `false` resulting in nothing being rendered in the UI.

:::note

Note that even though `&&` is commonly used and generally works for most situations, there are edge cases, such as when the condition evaluates to `0` or `undefined` , where it may result in unexpected behaviors.
